I’m currently teaching at [California State University Long Beach](https://www.csulb.edu/) as a part-time lecturer in the [College of Professional and Continuing Education’s](https://www.cpace.csulb.edu/) [Master of Science in Geographic Information Science](https://www.cpace.csulb.edu/courses/degree-programs/master-of-science-in-geographic-information-science) program. I like to keep things laid-back in the classroom and create a relaxed atmosphere where students can ask questions and feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. Seeing my students develop their skills and passion for GIScience is really awesome, and I’m proud to play a part in their journey.

## Courses
**GISC 605 - Programming for Geospatial Professionals**
