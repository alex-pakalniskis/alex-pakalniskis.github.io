Hey there! I'm an engineer who loves building cool tools, creating educational content, and teaching courses. My team ([IndexerDAO](https://www.indexerdao.com/)) and I have been fortunate enough to receive over 250,000 GRT in funding from [The Graph Grants program](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/grants/) for our developer education projects since December 2022. If you want to hear more about my story, check out [Episode 95](https://www.grtiq.com/grtiq-podcast-95-alex-pakalniskis/) of the GRTiQ Podcast.

I'm not one to be pushy, but I do want to make it as easy as possible for you to connect with me. Whether you're interested in discussing potential freelance opportunities or just want to chat, I'm excited to connect with you at your convenience. Send me an email and let's talk about how I can help your business succeed!
