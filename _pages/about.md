I create web3 tools and developer education content. Since December 2022, my team and I have received over 250,000 GRT in funding from [The Graph Grants](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/grants/) program for our projects. You can hear more about my story so far by listening to [Episode 95](https://www.grtiq.com/grtiq-podcast-95-alex-pakalniskis/) of the GRTiQ Podcast. 

Schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/alexpakalniskis3/30min) if you'd like to chat.
