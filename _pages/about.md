Hey there! I'm a web3 engineer who loves building cool tools, creating educational content, and teaching courses. My team ([IndexerDAO](https://www.indexerdao.com/)) and I have been fortunate enough to receive over 250,000 GRT in funding from [The Graph Grants program](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/grants/) for our developer education projects since December 2022. If you want to hear more about my story, check out [Episode 95](https://www.grtiq.com/grtiq-podcast-95-alex-pakalniskis/) of the GRTiQ Podcast.

I don't want to be one of those pushy people, but I do want to let you know that I've made it super easy for you to schedule a meeting with me at your convenience via Calendly. All you have to do is click on [this link](https://calendly.com/alexpakalniskis3/30min) and select a time that works best for you. I'm really excited to chat with you about any potential freelance opportunities and how I can help your business thrive. So, if you're interested, let's connect!
