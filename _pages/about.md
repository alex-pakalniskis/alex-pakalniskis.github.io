> At my core, I believe in the power of open-source software, permissionless/censorship resistant systems, and open APIs to drive innovation and foster a more equitable world.

I create educational content to empower [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) protocol community members to utilize and contribute to web3 technologies. My team ([IndexerDAO](https://www.indexerdao.com/)) and I have been fortunate enough to receive over 250,000 [GRT](https://www.coinbase.com/converter/grt/usd) in funding from [The Graph Grants program](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/grants/) for our developer education initiatives since December 2022. If you want to hear more about my story so far, check out [Episode 95](https://www.grtiq.com/grtiq-podcast-95-alex-pakalniskis/) of the GRTiQ Podcast.
