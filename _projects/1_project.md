[IndexerDAO](https://www.indexerdao.com/) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) dedicated to supporting the Indexer community within The Graph ecosystem. Our mission is to empower new and aspiring Indexers with ongoing education and project-based learning opportunities, as well as to drive innovation in the indexing space through the testing of R&D efforts from core developers. We are also a [multi-chain indexer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/profile/0x223260f3ca014adc40c98d50d5c4178657d53e26?view=Indexing&chain=mainnet) contributing data infrastructure to [The Graph protocol](https://thegraph.com/en/).
