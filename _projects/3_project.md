I'm committed to building a strong community in [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) ecosystem. Recently, I was thrilled to receive a Graph Grant to support my efforts to create Graph Advocates Stickers in collaboration with artist [Shawn Nutting](https://www.instagram.com/chon_ta2/). These stickers are being designed to help community members identify and connect with each other and promote our decentralized community at web3 events. In the future, I plan to continue creating swag for the Graph Advocates community, such as tote bags, event banners, and apparel, all aimed at fostering a sense of unity and pride among Advocates.
