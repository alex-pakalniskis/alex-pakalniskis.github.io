My freelance developer education efforts are focused on content and virtual events to support [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) protocol community. In addition to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@alexpakalniskis), I've created [Rust tutorials](https://alex-pakalniskis.github.io/RustOfficeHoursResources/) and organized live coding events to help developers learn and build in The Graph protocol. These efforts have been recognized by [The Graph Grants program](https://thegraph.com/ecosystem/grants/), with Rust Office Hours Resources and Code Along with Alex each being awarded significant grant funding.
